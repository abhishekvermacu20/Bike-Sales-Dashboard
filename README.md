I recently completed a comprehensive Excel project encompassing requirement gathering, data cleaning, processing, analysis, and dashboard creation. This end-to-end data analytics project equipped me with valuable skills and insights crucial for the role of a data analyst. As a recent graduate, I found this hands-on experience invaluable in understanding the workflow of real-world projects. By mastering Excel tools and techniques through practical projects like this, I am now better prepared to tackle data analysis challenges in professional settings. Looking forward to applying these skills in my future endeavors and contributing to impactful projects
